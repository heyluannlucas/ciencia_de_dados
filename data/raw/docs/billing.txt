The other pillar being Identity and Access Management (IAM) üë§. This highlight the strategic importance of the domain, not only for cloud providers but virtually any business, especially those who are software-centric. Pricing, my only growth hack at Qonto - Most businesses don't know how to iterate over pricing: sales teams dictates them without involvement of the people in charge of implementation, which ends up in frustration for all.

Customer Lifetime Value How much net value do you produce per customer? The Customer Lifetime Value (CLV, or LTV for Life-Time Value) quantify that. Understanding and acting on it is the most important part of your business's sales efforts. You're all calculating churn rates wrong - ‚ÄúOn the surface, churn rate may seem like a natural proxy for changes in customer lifetimes. Let's dig into why that is not true.‚Äù Churn rate is not a meaningful metric to compute CLV: during the customer lifetime, the churn probability is not constant. Most of the time because of your free trial and vouchers. This article illustrate the influence of the distribution used to model the probability of a customer quitting.

Data Engineering To industrialize data production and consumption, your need data engineers to clean up, persist and consolidate data. Only after you get these data foundations you might think of onboarding data scientists. AI vs Data Science vs Data Engineering - ‚ÄúData Engineers build data pipelines and infrastructure to ensure a constant availability of transformed data. Data Scientists analyze and build models from these data to develop new product features or drive the bottom line of the business.‚Äù As for AI professionals, their focus is on cognitive automation. Ten Ways Your Data Project is Going to Fail - You don't need data scientists. ‚ÄúFor ETL, hire data engineers. For reporting, hire BI analysts. The end.‚Äù Cargo cult data science - ‚ÄúData science is best viewed as a form of company culture, rather than a set of technologies. However, many firms will try to create that company culture by acquiring data-science technology, rather than working on their culture.‚Äù Why not use Double or Float to represent currency? - Because of precision: floats and doubles cannot accurately represent the base 10 multiples that we use for money. Never Use Floats for Money - ‚ÄúThis is precisely the problem we have when trying to represent 10^-1, or 0.1 in binary. There is not an exact binary representation of 0.1 or 0.01.‚Äù The Soul of an Old Machine: Revisiting the Timeless von Neumann Architecture - Floats were suspicious even before the first general-purpose computer (EDVAC) was built: ‚ÄúVon Neumann wasn't entirely sold on why we might need floating-point numbers. He was quite vocal in his critique of floating-point numbers.‚Äù The author of this article complement this critique by illustrating the issue of precision and rounding.
