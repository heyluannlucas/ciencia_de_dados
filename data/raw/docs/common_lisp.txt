For awesome software, see lisp-lang.org's success stories and the awesome-cl-software list. All libraries listed here are available from Quicklisp unless stated otherwise. The ones marked with a ‚≠ê are so widespread and solid that they became community standards. You can't be wrong with them. This is the case for Quicklisp, BordeauxThreads and such. Libraries denoted with a üëç are the ones we like and want to promote here at the Awesome-cl list. They proved solid, they may solve a problem better than a community standard but they aren't as widespread, or not considered as stable. For example, we prefer Spinneret over Cl-Who. Add something new! See the contributing section for adding something to the list. This is released under the GNU Free Documentation License - its text is provided in the LICENSE file.

Contributing Your contributions are always welcome! Please submit a pull request or create an issue to add a new framework, library or software to the list. The rules we (try to) respect are the followings: by default, add a library to the end of its section. absolute de-facto libraries, like BordeauxThreads or Quicklisp, should be denoted with a ‚≠ê (Unicode code U+2B50). two libraries very similar in scope should be side by side, or in a section of their own. do some curation based on your experience and the state of the library's documentation. We do not aim at listing every existing CL library (see Cliki for that) nor to list every "popular" library (see Quicklisp stats). as such, the libraries we like best are marked with a üëç (1F44D unicode character).
