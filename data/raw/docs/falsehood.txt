The logic of the world is prior to all truth and falsehood. ‚Äî Ludwig Wittgenstein[1] A curated list of falsehoods programmers believe in. A falsehood is an idea that you initially believed was true, but in reality, it is proven to be false. E.g. of an idea: valid email address exactly has one @ character. So, you will use this rule to implement your email-field validation logic. Right? Wrong! The reality is: emails can have multiple @ chars. Therefore your implementation should allow this. The initial idea is a falsehood you believed in. The falsehood articles listed below will have a comprehensive list of those false-beliefs that you should be aware of, to help you become a better programmer.
