Scientific computing and numerical analysis are research fields that aim to provide methods for solving large-scale problems from various areas of science with the help of computers. Typical problems are ordinary and partial differential equations (ODEs, PDEs), their discretizations, and the solution of linear algebra problems arising from them.
