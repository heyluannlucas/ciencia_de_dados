FormAlchemy FormAlchemy eliminates boilerplate by autogenerating HTML input fields from a given model. FormAlchemy will try to figure out what kind of HTML code should be returned by introspecting the model's properties and generate ready-to-use HTML code that will fit the developer's application. WTForms-Alchemy WTForms-Alchemy is a WTForms extension toolkit for easier creation of model based forms. Strongly influenced by Django ModelForm. Sprox Sprox provides an easy way to create forms for web content which are: automatically generated, easy to customize, and validated.

SQLTap helps you understand: how many times a sql query is executed how much time your sql queries take where your application is issuing sql queries from nplusone Auto-detect the n+1 queries problem in SQLAlchemy (and other Python ORMs) nplusone detects unnecessary queries caused by lazy loading and unused eager loading. Integrates with Flask-SQLAlchemy. Query helpers sqlakeyset This library implements keyset-based paging for SQLAlchemy (both ORM and core). This library has been tested with PostgreSQL and MariaDB/MySQL. It should work with other SQLAlchemy-supported databases to provided they support row( syntax.
