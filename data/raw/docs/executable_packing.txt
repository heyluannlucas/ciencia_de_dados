Packing is the action of modifying an executable in a way that does not modify its purpose. It is generally one or a combination of the following operations: bundling: makes a single executable with multiple files compression: compresses the executable to reduce its original size encoding: obfuscates the executable by encoding it encryption: obfuscates the executable by encrypting it mutation: alters the executable's code so that it uses a modifided instruction set and architecture (e.g. using oligomorphism) protection: makes the reversing of the executable harder (i.e. using anti-debugging, anti-tampering or other tricks) virtualization: embeds a virtual machine that allows to virtualize executable's instructions Contents 📚 Literature Documentation Scientific Research 📑 Datasets 📦 Packers After 2010 Between 2000 and 2010 Before 2000 🔧 Tools 📚 Literature Documentation 🌎 a.out (FreeBSD manual pages) 🌎 A.out binary format 🌎 About anti-debug tricks 📊 Android packers: Separating from the pack 📌 Anti debugging protection techniques with examples 📄 Anti-unpacker tricks 📄 Anti-unpacker tricks - Part 14 (and previous parts) 📊 API deobfuscator: Resolving obfuscated API functions in modern packers 📗 The art of memory forensics: Detecting malware and threats in Windows, Linux, and mac memory 📊 The art of unpacking 🌎 Awesome executable packing 📌 Cloak and dagger: Unpacking hidden malware attacks 📖 Cluster analysis 🌎 Clustering algorithms 🌎 COM binary format 🌎 Common object file format (COFF) 🌎 Comparison of executable file formats 📰 A complexity measure 📰 Cyclomatic complexity density and software maintenance productivity 🌎 Defacto2 📰 Do we need hundreds of classiﬁers to solve real world classiﬁcation problems? 📊 Dynamic binary analysis and obfuscated codes 🌎 elf (FreeBSD manual pages) 📌 Entropy and the distinctive signs of packer PE files 🌎 Executable and linkable format (ELF) 📋 Executable and linking format (ELF) specification 🌎 Executable file formats 🌎 FatELF: Universal binaries for Linux (HALTED) 📰 Feature selection: A data perspective 📰 How to use t-SNE effectively 📋 Hyperion: Implementation of a PE-Crypter 📜 Implementing your own generic unpacker 📌 Mach-O - A look at apple executable files 🌎 Mach-O file format reference 📊 Mach-O internals 📖 Machine learning 📌 Making our own executable packer 📰 The matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) should replace the ROC AUC as the standard metric for assessing binary classification 📋 Microsoft portable executable and common object file format specification 🌎 MITRE ATT&CK | T1027.002 | obfuscated files or information: Software packing 🌎 MZ disk operating system (DOS) 📊 NotPacked++: Evading static packing detection 🔖 On the worst-case complexity of timsort 📊 One packer to rule them all: Empirical identification, comparison and circumvention of current antivirus detection techniques 📜 One packer to rule them all: Empirical identification, comparison and circumvention of current antivirus detection techniques 📌 Packer detection tool evaluation 📄 Packers 📊 Packing-box: Breaking detectors & visualizing packing 📊 Packing-box: Improving detection of executable packing 📊 Packing-box: Playing with executable packing 📌 Parsing mach-O files 📗 Pattern recognition and machine learning (Information science and statistics) 🌎 PE format - Win32 apps 📜 PinDemonium: A DBI-based generic unpacker for Windows executables 🌎 Portable executable (PE) 📗 Practical malware analysis: The hands-on guide to dissecting malicious software 📌 ProtectMyTooling - Don't detect tools, detect techniques 📊 Reverse engineering malware: Binary obfuscation and protection 📊 Runtime packers: The hidden problem? 🔖 A survey of dimensionality reduction techniques 📊 TitanMist: Your first step to reversing nirvana 📌 Tuts 4 you - UnPackMe (.NET) 📌 Tuts 4 you | unpackme 📗 The "Ultimate" anti-debugging reference 📌 Unpacking, reversing, patching 📊 Virtual machine obfuscation 📊 We can still crack you!
