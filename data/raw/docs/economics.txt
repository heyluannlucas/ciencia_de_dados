Courses include prerequisites, recommended textbooks, lecture slides, and assignments. Undergraduate and graduate programs. edX Economics - Introductory topics, few prerequisites. Khan Academy: Economics - Elementary topics. Useful Materials Academic Search - Search across .edu and other educational domains. These materials are more reliable than the big Internet. Foundational Equations of Economics - These equations show principles behind "thinking like an economist". Graduate textbooks put these equiations in context. IGM Economic Experts Panel - Top economists reflect on policy-related issues. Some answers contain useful details.

Research Portals RePEc - Web services for economic researchers: bibliography, blog aggregator, new working papers, software. Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis: Web Services - A list of helpful services. Articles and Working Papers IDEAS RePEc - The largest database of economics publications (2,000,000 items). Searching through papers is easier with Google: site:ideas.repec.org <search term>. Index sources mentioned below. NBER - Working papers by major researchers. Many of these papers get published in peer-reviewed journal. SSRN Economics - Working papers, no journal publications. Google Scholar - Searching academic literature in general. Features author pages and citation counters. If you look for economic writings only, IDEAS would be more powerful. Data Datasets FRED2 - 380,000 (macro) time series from 80 sources. Supports plugins for importing data into Excel, Stata, R, and others. Has a mobile app. World Bank Data - International macro time series. Has data import plugins. IMF Data - The standard reference for macro data. Quandl - Aggregate financial and economic data from multiple sources. Some data vendors sell their data via this service. Good integration with statistical software. MEDevEcon - Data related to development economics. Monetary Economics: Data Sources - Overview of macro data sources. OFFSTATS - Links to official data sources by country and subject. Search International Open Government Dataset Search - Over 1,000,000 government datasets. When works, this service looks like this. Otherwise, you'll see a 403 error. Dataset Search Engine - Google-based search over 200 data sources, including those mentioned here. You can use Google search operators here. StackExchange Open Data - If you haven't found the data you were looking for, you can ask it here. Reddit /r/datasets - One more place to request datasets. Software Writing LaTeX - Economists write in LaTeX because it handles mathematics and references better than Word or LibreOffice. If you write regularly, LaTeX is worth learning. Beamer - A LaTeX class for presentations. TikZ - An extension for drawing graphs. A how-to and a manual. LyX - A free and simple editor for LaTeX. Zotero - Bibliography management. Also install (a) Zotero browser plugin to import papers from RePEc to your library; (b) Zotero-LyX plugin to cite literature easily. Git - A version control system. Useful if you want to revert changes done months ago or collaborate with other authors. DropBox also has version control, but Git is more explicit. A short intro. Or use GitHub Desktop if you like it simple. Mendeley - Bibliography management. Support synchronization on multiple plateforms: Mac, Windows, Ipad, Phone... Computing Stata - An industry standard for statistical computations in economics. Free alternatives: IPython - A Python-based environment. Econometric analysis is done with free packages: statsmodels, SciPy, NumPy, pandas. RStudio - An R-based environment. R is the standard language among statisticians, so the R repositories often contain specialized libraries not available in other languages. Matlab - An industry standard for modeling and numerical optimization in economics. Free alternatives: Octave Julia - High-level dynamic programming language designed to address the needs of high-performance numerical analysis and computational science. Mathematica - Symbolic computations. Free alternative Sage Julia - An open source scientific computing softerware. Sharing GitHub - A repository for code and data. Publishing research here is not a common practice, but it's more convenient that alternatives (university home page, DropBox, etc.). GitHub Pages - Simple static websites. GitHub LFS - Large file storage. IPython Notebooks - An interactive alternative to LaTeX and Word. See examples how notebooks look like in data-science-ipython-notebooks and the gallery.
