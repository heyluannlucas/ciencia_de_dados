The blockchain is an incorruptible digital ledger of economic transactions that can be programmed to record not just financial transactions but virtually everything of value (by Don Tapscott). Most applications of blockchain lie in a financial realm. That makes non-financial applications even more intriguing. Industry of a blockchain application is defined by the one that is changed the most. For example, discontinued IoT bitcoin micropayments startup 21 (now Earn.com) could significantly change both IoT and Financial sectors. Financial industry would expand its current practice to a new domain. For IoT, however, business model would change significantly. That intuition commands current classification.
