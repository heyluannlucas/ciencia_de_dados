Salt (often referred to as SaltStack) is the other configuration management system built with Python. It takes a new approach to infrastructure management by developing software that is easy enough to get running in seconds, scalable enough to manage tens of thousands of servers, and fast enough to control and communicate with them in milliseconds. SaltStack software manages system infrastructure and the application stacks that run on it and is used by web-scale application developers, DevOps teams and systems administrators.
