Creative technology is a broadly interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary field combining computing, design, art, and user experience. This list hopes to compile the best creative technology groups & resources across the world, both as a source of inspiration and as a reference point for potential employers and meetups of creative technologists. Creative technologists by definition have a breadth of skills as opposed to a specific specialty, so it's difficult to categorize them. While this isn't a perfect organization, each group below generally specializes in the area to which they've been assigned.
