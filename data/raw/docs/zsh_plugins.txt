Frameworks These frameworks make customizing your ZSH setup easier. You can find some interesting performance timing comparisons of various frameworks in the following locations. rossmacarthur/zsh-plugin-manager-benchmark - Contains performance benchmarks for the most popular ZSH frameworks, including both install time and load time. pm-perf-test - Tooling for running performance tests on multiple ZSH frameworks. alf Alf is an out of this world super fast and configurable framework for ZSH; it's modeled after Prezto and Antigen while utilizing Oh-My-Zsh under the covers; and offers standard defaults, aliases, functions, auto completion, automated updates and installable prompt themes and plugins. ansible-role-zsh ansible-role-zsh is an ansible role with zero-knowledge installation. It uses antigen to manage bundles and oh-my-zsh. Can load bundles conditionally. By default it includes the powerlevel9k theme, autosuggestions, syntax-highlighting and fzf-widgets and fzf-marks. Fully customizable. ant-zsh Ant-zsh is a tiny and lightweight ZSH configuration environment for special customization needs. It includes plugins, themes and a basic convenient setup. antibody Antibody is a faster and simpler antigen written in Golang. More details are available at http://getantibody.github.io/. antidote Antidote is a ZSH plugin manager made from the ground up thinking about performance. It is fast because it can do things concurrently, and generates an ultra-fast static plugin file that you can include in your ZSH config. It is written natively in ZSH, is well tested, and picks up where Antibody left off. use-omz enables easy use of Oh-My-ZSH with antidote. antigen-hs antigen-hs is a replacement for antigen optimized for a low overhead when starting up a zsh session. It will automatically clone plugins for you. antigen Antigen is a small set of functions that help you easily manage your shell (ZSH) plugins, called bundles. The concept is pretty much the same as bundles in a typical vim+pathogen setup. Antigen is to ZSH, what Vundle is to vim. Antigen can load oh-my-zsh themes and plugins and will automatically clone them for you. ax-zsh Ax-ZSH is a modular configuration system for ZSH. It provides sane defaults and is extendable by plugins. Ax-ZSH integrates well with Powerlevel10k and other extensions, including plugins compatible with oh-my-zsh. deer A minimalist ZSH plugin manager. dotzsh Dotzsh strives to be platform and version independent. Some functionality may be lost when running under older versions of ZSH, but it should degrade cleanly and allow you to use the same setup on multiple machines of differing OSes without problems. fresh fresh is a tool to source shell configuration (aliases, functions, etc) from others into your own configuration files. We also support files such as ackrc and gitconfig. Think of it as Bundler for your dot files. gh-source gh-source is a plugin manager for people who don't like plugin managers. It's a simple shell function that downloads and installs plugins from GitHub as part of the sourcing step. It's designed to be used with zsh, but it should work with any shell. miniplug miniplug is a minimalistic plugin manager for ZSH. No crashes or double plugin loading when re-sourcing .zshrc Unlike other frameworks, Miniplug does not pollute your $PATH Only does the bare minimum for managing plugins oh-my-zsh oh-my-zsh is a community-driven framework for managing your ZSH configuration. Includes 120+ optional plugins (rails, git, macOS, hub, capistrano, brew, ant, MacPorts, etc), over 120 themes to spice up your morning, and an auto-update tool that makes it easy to keep up with the latest updates from the community. PMS PMS allows you to manage your shell in a way to that helps decrease setup time and increases your productivity. It has support for themes (change the way your shell looks), plugins (adds functionality to your shell), and dotfile management. The PMS framework also allows you to use the same framework in different shells. Use ZSH on your personal laptop, and use bash on remote servers. Wanna try fish? Go ahead, try out different shells. prezto Prezto enriches the ZSH command line interface environment with sane defaults, aliases, functions, auto completion, and prompt themes. There are some prezto-specific plugins at https://github.com/belak/prezto-contrib. pumice Pumice is a lightweight plugin manager for ZSH. ryzshrc ryzshrc is a smart, innovative plugin manager like Oh My Zsh, designed to enhance your terminal experience with professional and cool features. It boosts productivity by providing efficient shell management, sleek themes, and powerful plugins. Perfect for developers seeking a modern and intelligent way to work with their terminal sheldon A fast, configurable, shell plugin manager. Can manage Any git repository. Branch/tag/commit support. Extra support for GitHub repositories. Extra support for Gists. Arbitrary remote files, simply specify the URL. Local plugins, simply specify the directory path. Highly configurable install methods using handlebars templating. Super-fast parallel installation. Configuration file using TOML syntax. Uses a lock file for much faster loading of plugins. shplug An easy solution for managing your shell environments. Works with both bash and zsh. Makes it easy to sync your environment across multiple machines with a git repository. TheFly bash/zsh/ksh plugin manager and env teleporter Makes your shell env and plugins available everywhere (hosts/users)! Toasty Toasty is a ZSH framework made to facilitate management, not dictate it. uz A ZSH micro plugin manager. x-cmd x-cmd is a toolset implemented using posix shell and awk.It is very small in size and offers many interesting features. Here is a milestone demo: https://x-cmd.com/ Tools Provided by x-cmd: Wrappers for Common Commands (e.g., cd, ip, ps, tar, apt, brew): These wrapped commands are more intelligent and easier to use compared to the native commands. Lightweight Package Management Tool: We have implemented a lightweight package management tool using shell and awk. Through it, you can quickly obtain most common software tools, such as jq, 7za, bat, nvim, python, node, go, etc. CLI for Useful Websites (e.g., github.com, cht.sh): We have wrapped their APIs using shell and awk for daily use and to obtain corresponding services in scripts. AI Tools: We provide CLIs for ChatGPT, Gemini, Jina.ai, etc., and have wrapped corresponding shortcut commands for different application scenarios, such as @gemini for chatting with Gemini AI and @zh for using AI to translate specified content or command results. yazt Yazt is a simple ZSH theme manager in maintenance that is compatible with nearly everything. You can use prompts in plugins, mix 'n' match two themes and with a few modifications, you can even use it in bash. yzsh yzsh is a simple ZSH framework for managing plugins, themes, functions, aliases and environment variables. zap zap is a minimal ZSH plugin manager. zapack zapack is a basic fast minimal ZSH plugin loader. zcomet zcomet is a minimalistic ZSH plugin manager that gets you to the prompt surprisingly quickly without caching (see the benchmarks). In addition to loading and updating plugins stored in git repositories, it supports lazy-loading plugins (further reducing startup time) as well as downloading and sourcing code snippets. zeesh Zeesh is a cross-platform ZSH framework. It's similar to, but incompatible with, oh-my-zsh. It has a modular plugin architecture making it easy to extend. It has a rich set of defaults, but is designed to be as lightweight as possible. zgem zgem is a plugin manager for ZSH that supports loading and updating plugins and themes from git, http and local files. zgen Zgen is currently not being actively maintained and I recommend you use the zgenom fork instead, which is actively maintained and continues to get new features. Zgen is a lightweight plugin manager for ZSH inspired by Antigen. The goal is to have minimal overhead when starting up the shell because nobody likes waiting. zgenom A lightweight plugin manager for ZSH that is a fork that extends the brilliant zgen and provides more features and bugfixes while being fully backwards compatible. To keep loading fast during new terminal sessions, zgenom generates a static init.zsh file which does nothing but source your plugins and append them to your fpath. This minimizes startup time by not having to execute time consuming logic (plugin checking, updates, etc) during every shell session's startup. The downside is that you have to refresh the init script manually with zgenom reset whenever you update your plugin list in your .zshrc. Zgenom can load oh-my-zsh-compatible and prezto-compatible plugins and themes, and will automagically git clone plugins for you when you add them to your plugin list. zilsh zilsh is a ZSH config system that aims to appeal more to power-users and follow the simplistic approach of vim-pathogen. zim Zim is a ZSH configuration framework with blazing speed and modular extensions. Zinit Zinit is an innovative and probably (because of the Turbo) the fastest plugin manager with support for: Turbo mode ‚Äì 80% faster ZSH startup! for example: instead of 200 ms, it'll be 40 ms Completion management (selectively disable and enable completions) Snippets (‚Üî regular files downloaded via-URL, e.g.: scripts) and through them Oh My Zsh and Prezto plugins support (‚Üí low overhead) Annexes (‚Üî Zinit extensions) Reports (from the plugin loads ‚Äì plugins are no longer black boxes) Plugin unloading (allows e.g.: dynamic theme switching) bindkey capturing and remapping packages Clean fpath (the array $fpath is not being used to add completions and autoload functions, hence it stays concise, not bloated) Services ‚Üî a single-instance, background plugins Also, in general: all the mechanisms from the ZSH Plugin Standard ‚Äì Zinit is a reference implementation of the standard. The project is very active ‚Äì currently > 3100 commits. zinit-4 This is Zinit 4 from the original author, who once removed the Zinit repository from GitHub. This spawned a community-driven zdharma-continuum organization that revived all of psprint's ZSH projects. Its main innovations from the @zdharma-continuum fork are: AppImage distribution (release link), Action complete ‚Äì press Alt-Shift-A and Alt-Shift-C to complete plugin names and ice modifiers, Themes ‚Äì set $ZITHEME to one of default, blue and gold to set a color set to use for Zinit 4 messages, New ice build which is equivalent of three other ices: null, configure and make install and simply builds the project from sources, with support for autotools/CMake/Meson/Scons. These are the most visible changes, but there are more (like e.g.: support for compiling with libraries from previously built projects/$ZPFX). zit zit is a plugin manager for ZSH. It is minimal because it implements the bare minimum to be qualified as a plugin manager: it allows the user to install plugins from git repositories (and git repositories only, that's why the name), source plugins and update them. It does not implement fancy functions like cleanup of removed plugins, automatic compilation of installed plugins, alias for oh-my-zsh/prezto/other ZSH frameworks, building binaries, $PATH manipulation and others. zlugin zlugin is a very lightweight ZSH plugin manager. znap ‚ö°Znap is a light-weight plugin manager & git repository manager for ZSH that's easy to grok. While tailored for ZSH plugins specifically, Znap also functions as a general-purpose utility for managing git repositories. Znap can: Make any prompt appear instantly. Reduce your startup time from ~200ms to ~40ms with just one command. Asynchronously compile your plugins and functions. Cache those expensive eval $(commands). Clone or pull multiple repos in parallel. Re-clone all your repos without you having to re-enter them. Multi-repo management Automatic compinit and bashinit - you no longer need them in your .zshrc, znap will do them automatically as needed. zoppo Zoppo is the crippled configuration framework for ZSH. As an Italian saying goes: "chi va con lo zoppo, impara a zoppicare", we realized we were walking with a cripple and are now going to become crippled ourselves. zpacker Zpacker is a lightweight ZSH plugin & theme management framework. zpico The minuscule ZSH package manager. No frills, no bloat, just 2 kB of 100% ZSH code, providing complete package management for your ZSH environment. ZSH package managers are abundant, but most are bloated, slow or have excessive requirements. On top of that, more than a few have been abandoned for years. Zpico does not seek to be the best of the best, rather to balance functionality against a tiny, fast footprint. zplug üå∫ Zplug is a next-generation ZSH plugin manager. Can manage everything ZSH plugins/UNIX commands on GitHub and Bitbucket Gist files (gist.github.com) Externally managed plugins e.g., oh-my-zsh and prezto plugins/themes Binary artifacts on GitHub Releases Local plugins etc. (you can add your own sources!) Super-fast parallel installation/update Support for lazy-loading Branch/tag/commit support Post-update, post-load hooks Dependencies between packages Unlike antigen, no ZSH plugin files (*.plugin.zsh) are required Interactive interface (fzf, peco, zaw, and so on) Cache mechanism for reducing the startup time zpm zpm ( ZSH Plugin Manager ) is a plugin manager for ZSH which combines the imperative and declarative approach. At first run, zpm will do complex logic and generate a cache, after that will only use the cache, so it makes this framework very fast. Fastest plugin manager (Really, after the first run, zpm will not be used at all) Support for async loading Dependencies between packages zpm runs on Linux, macOS, FreeBSD and Android. zpm plugins are compatible with oh-my-zsh. zr zr is a quick, simple ZSH plugin manager written in Rust and easily installable with cargo install zr. zshing zshing is a ZSH plugin manager similar to Vundle/Vim and allows you to... Keep track of and configure your plugins right in the .zshrc Install ZSH plugins Update ZSH plugins Search by name all available ZSH Plugins Clean unused plugins up Run the above actions in a single command Manages the Source Plugins of your installed Plugins zsh-dot-plugin Customize your .zshrc with only ~21 lines of code.

Installation I recommend zgenom if you don't already have a preferred ZSH framework. It adds minimal overhead during shell session startup because it generates a load script only when you change your plugin list, and that load script is sourced during startup instead of being recalculated every time. Antigen Most of these plugins can be installed by adding antigen bundle githubuser/reponame to your .zshrc file. Antigen will handle cloning the plugin for you automatically the next time you start zsh. You can also add the plugin to a running ZSH with antigen bundle githubuser/reponame for testing before adding it to your .zshrc. dotzsh Clone new plugins into .zsh.local/modules Load the plugin module in .zshrc Open a new ZSH terminal window or tab Oh-My-Zsh cd ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins git clone repo Add the repo to your plugin list Prezto Clone the plugin into your prezto modules directory Add the plugin to your .zpreztorc file Open a new terminal window or tab Zgen Zgen is not being actively maintained. I recommend that you switch to the Zgenom fork, which is. Zgenom Most of these plugins can be installed by adding zgenom load githubuser/reponame to your .zshrc file in the same function you're doing your other zgenom load calls in. Zgenom will automatically clone the plugin repositories for you when you do a zgenom save. zplug Most of these plugins can be installed by adding zplug "githubuser/reponame" to your .zshrc file. zpm Most of these plugins can be installed by adding zpm load "githubuser/reponame" to your .zshrc file.
