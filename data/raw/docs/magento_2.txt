What is an awesome list? Contribution guide Table of Contents What is Magento? Events Frontends Tools Open Source Extensions Blogs Education Platforms Official Resources What is Magento? Magento is an open-source e-commerce application that allows you to create webshops. We often speak of a frontend (the storefront where customers buy products) and a backend (the Magento Admin Panel where customers and products are being managed). The open source bit refers to the fact that the source code of Magento (PHP, HTML, CSS, JS, XML, and others) is distributed under an open-source license (OSLv3) that allows anyone to reuse the code and make changes to it. This open-source aspect has led to the massive popularity of the product Magento so that we often use the word Magento to refer to either the product, the community around it or both. Magento was started by a company called Varien, and with Magento version 1 (first released in 2008), popularity began to grow. Magento version 2 was first released in November 2015 but faced a problematic adoption because of its complex architecture and outdated features (KnockoutJS, RequireJS, Zend Framework 1). On the storefront part, this led to various new frontends. In 2018, Magento was acquired by Adobe. Later, Magento Enterprise was integrated into the Adobe cloud as Adobe Commerce Cloud, while the Magento Community Edition was relabeled Magento Open Source. In the community, there was uncertainty whether Adobe would maintain Magento Open Source in the long run in the way the community would see fit. This uncertainty led to a community initiative called Mage-OS. Also see: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magento Events: Meet the community MageUnconference ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª - A Magento Unconference in Germany. MageUnconference ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡± - A Magento Unconference in the Netherlands. Meet Commerce - A global series of conferences focused on commerce and innovation.

Meet Magento Baltics Meet Magento Brazil Meet Magento Florida Meet Magento India Meet Magento Malaysia Meet Magento Netherlands Meet Magento New York City Meet Magento Poland Meet Magento Romania Meet Magento Singapore Meet Magento UK Front-ends The storefront of Magento 2 can be styled in numerous ways: Luma (Magento/luma) - This is actually a default demo theme of Magento 2 itself, which again extends from Magento/blank which extends from the core. But more often, the name Luma refers to the entire stack: XML layout generates a tree-structure of blocks and containers, which eventually render via PHTML templates. The server-side rendered HTML is enriched with CSS (compiled from LESS source files) and JavaScript (RequireJS, KnockoutJS, jQuery). Adobe PWA Studio - A new headless frontend, created by Adobe/Magento, based on ReactJS. It makes GraphQL calls to the Magento GraphQL API to retrieve data. The frontend offers Venia (a demo theme and UI component library), Peregrine (React hooks), Buildpack (Webpack configuration) and UPWARD (a middleware for SSR and image optimization). HyvÃ¤ (hyva.io) - An alternative for Luma, which replaces the LESS/CSS with TailwindCSS and the JavaScript with AlpineJS. Currently, it is only available via a commercial license. But for that price, the team works hard to create compatibility modules for 3rd party modules, give support and make the entire solution more and more versatile.
