Limiter - Rate-limiting middleware. Use to limit repeated requests to public APIs and/or endpoints such as password reset. Logger - HTTP request/response logger. Monitor - Monitor middleware that reports server metrics, inspired by express-status-monitor. Pprof - Pprof middleware that serves via its HTTP server runtime profiling data in the format expected by the pprof visualization tool. Proxy - Allows you to proxy requests to a multiple servers. Recover - Recover middleware recovers from panics anywhere in the stack chain and handles the control to the centralized ErrorHandler. Redirect - Redirect middleware for Fiber. RequestID - Adds a requestid to every request. Rewrite - Rewrite middleware rewrites the URL path based on provided rules. It can be helpful for backward compatibility or just creating cleaner and more descriptive links. Session - Session middleware. NOTE: This middleware uses our Storage package. Skip - Skip middleware that skips a wrapped handler is a predicate is true.
