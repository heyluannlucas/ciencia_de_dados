Qt is a powerful cross-platform application development framework, for use primarily (but not exclusively) in C++. It's great for GUI applications, but can be used for many other things as well. Contributions are welcome! Conventions Any list item with an OctoCat has a GitHub repo or organization; click on it to see the source code! List items with this ðŸ“¦ icon have source code hosted elsewhere. Contents Official Resources Communities Official Unofficial Tools Official Tools Third-Party Tools Bindings in Other Languages Libraries Integrations New Functionality Software Repositories Blogs Books Software that Uses Qt Other Relevant Awesome Lists License Official Resources Official Website - The official website for the Qt framework. Qt Documentation - Official Qt documentation. Massive and comprehensive. Qt Newsletters - The best of Qt, straight to your spam filter. Qt Bug Tracker - If you think you've found a bug with Qt or one of its related projects, report it here (or see if someone else already has). Qt Code Review - See how the Qt maintainers ensure their code is well-written. Source Code - Browse the various source trees that comprise the Qt project. Has mirrors at several GitHub organizations: Qt Qt Project Qt Labs Communities If you build it, they will come. This section describes aggregations of Qt users who share knowledge and code with one another. The most popular and active communities are listed in this section, but you can find a more comprehensive list here (that includes several in other languages) if you'd prefer. Official Mailing Lists - Mailing lists for users and developers of Qt alike. Arguably the best place to communicate directly with Qt's maintainers. Sees frequent activity. Qt Forum - If e-mail's not your thing, then you might also consider getting help or sharing knowledge on the forums. Qt Wiki - The premier source for user-contributed Qt knowledge. IRC - For real-time chat with other Qt developers and users. The most popular channels are on Freenode, and include #qt, #qt-quick, #qt-creator, and #qt-chat. For a full list of Qt-related IRC channels, see here. Note that the linked webchat client is not a part of the Qt project, and is provided by the author of this list for convenience only. These channels can be accessed through any IRC client. Unofficial QtForum.org - Not to be confused with the official Qt forum. Tools A good developer writes his or her own tools. A great one uses tools others wrote. This section will help you be great; more formally, this section details applications that make it easier to create software with Qt. You may also be interested in the Libraries section. Official Tools The Qt framework has surprisingly many tools that don't get the spotlight. This section describes them (as well as the star players that do). For the purpose of this section, "tool" refers to Qt-centric utilities whose code does not get embedded within your application (but their output might). Qt Creator - By no means does Qt lock you into its provided IDE, but its firm integration with the framework makes it a good sell. Among other things, it provides a UI designer, modeling tools, a documentation browser, and great QML support if you're into that sort of thing. There's also a plugin system, but third-party plugins are unfortunately scarce. Qt Designer - If you'd rather just design the interfaces and let someone else hook them up to logic, the GUI designer is available as a separate application. Qt Assistant - So is the documentation viewer, for that matter. Qt Visual Studio Add-in - If you'd rather stick to Visual Studio, this add-in will let you do that. Qt Linguist - Qt provides excellent internationalization/localization support, and this tool is very much responsible for it. Write translatable strings in your code with special macros, and this tool will aggregate them all for you so you or your translator(s) can broaden your software's audience. Qt Installer Framework - Nobody seems to talk about this, but Qt also provides a way to write an installer for your application. Does not support creation of macOS disk images, app bundles, or Linux packages, so be mindful of that when considering your project's distribution. macdeployqt - Generates macOS application bundles for Qt projects. qmake - The bundled build system designed for Qt, though it can be used for non-Qt projects. qbs - If QML is more your style, consider this alternative build system. Emulator - Don't forget about Qt's mobile support! qtdiag - Command-line tool that prints out a lot of information pertaining to both your Qt installation and your system in general. No link because there's no dedicated web page; just run qtdiag on the command line. Excellent for troubleshooting. qmleasing - Lets you make easing curves suitable for QML, though if you understand the underlying math there's no reason you couldn't use the resulting numbers elsewhere. Third-Party Tools CMake - General C++ build tool that happens to have great Qt support. GammaRay - Powerful debugger and general inspection tool for Qt-built software. Lets you inspect and manipulate the QObject hierarchy, view object properties, edit widgets at runtime, and far, far more. A two-sentence blurb can't do it justice, seriously check it out. moc-ng - Alternative implementation of moc that's binary-compatible with Qt's version. Qt-Inspector - Inspection tool with similar goals to GammaRay, though much simpler. SIP ðŸ“¦ - Generates Python bindings for C or C++ libraries. Has special support for Qt signals and slots, and was used to create PyQt. linuxdeployqt - Lets you bundle your Qt based application as an AppDir or AppImage, making it possible to ship it to users of many desktop Linux distributions. Similar to the official windeployqt and macdeployqt tools but for Linux. Qompoter - Dependency manager for Qt / C++. Bindings in Other Languages This section describes software that enables creation of Qt software in a primary language other than C++. Libraries that allow run-time scripting in a Qt application are listed under Integrations. Python (via PyQt) ðŸ“¦ - Arguably the most comprehensive and well-known binding of Qt to another language. Python (via PySide) ðŸ“¦ - Another binding for Python, which has been officially adopted by the Qt project. Ring (via RingQt) - I've never heard of this language either, honestly. Mono/.NET languages (via QtSharp) - Experimental wrapper for Qt that allows it to be used by .NET-based languages such as C#. Young, but active. See these these three articles if you want more. Libraries This section describes two kinds of third-party libraries; those that provide their own brand-new functionality (e.g. widgets, dealing with particular file formats), and those that provide integrations with existing software (e.g. scripting languages, clients for REST APIs, implementations of established protocols). Integrations For the purpose of this section, an "Integration"-focused library does one of the following: Serves as a client for an established Web service. Wraps another library in a Qt-friendly manner as more than just an implementation detail (i.e. it tries to mimic the wrapped API). mupdf-qt - Qt wrapper for the MuPDF PDF viewer. neiasound - OpenAL wrapper designed for games, with stb_vorbis and libsndfile support. PythonQt ðŸ“¦ - Script your Qt applications with Python. Not to be confused with PyQt or PySide. QScintilla ðŸ“¦ - Absurdly versatile and customizable text editor widget that provides syntax highlighting, code completion, code folding, recordable macros, and much more. Built around Scintilla. Created by the same company that developed PyQt. QtAwesome - Add Font Awesome icons to your Qt application. Other icon sets are supported, too. QtLua ðŸ“¦ - Use Lua as a scripting language for Qt-based software. qtruby - Use Ruby as a scripting language within your application. QuaZIP ðŸ“¦ - Read from and write to ZIP archives. Uses Minizip under the hood. VLC-Qt - Wrapper for libvlc that lets you add a VLC-like media player to your application. SCodes - Qt & QML wrapper for ZXing-C++ Library with ready-made QML items for decoding and generating 1D and 2D barcodes (aka. QR codes). New Functionality Communi - Cross-platform IRC framework. We've got enough IRC clients out there already, but I suppose this could also be used to implement a chat function in your application (e.g. for community support). cutelyst - Web framework that takes some ideas from Perl's Catalyst framework. DiceParser - Dice Roller framework based on its own syntax. DOtherSide - Binding for QML in C, primarily designed as an API for other languages to support QML. Felgo - Cross-platform game engine and app framework that relies heavily on QML. Has a lot of tools and resources, and may even deserve its own list. glraw - Convert images from any Qt-supported format to OpenGL-format textures. Useful for speeding up texture loading in graphics applications. grantlee - Django-inspired text templating. injeqt - Dependency injection for Qt. KDE Frameworks ðŸ“¦ - Metric ass-ton of libraries for KDE, but many of them can be used with regular Qt applications as well. Cross-platform, for the most part. Marble ðŸ“¦ - Virtual globe and map that can be used standalone or embedded within other applications. qgexedit2 - Embed a hex editor in your application. qml-material - Material Design implemented in QML. QNodeView - Widget that lets you create and edit nodes in a graph similar to the kind provided by Unreal Engine, Substance Designer, or PureData. QSimpleUpdater - Let your application update itself. qt-maybe - Fans of type theory will enjoy these sum and optional types. qt-mustache - Render Mustache templates. QtAV - Actively developed multimedia framework. Qtilities - Powerful set of libraries that provide GUI, logging, testing, configuration, and project functionality (among other things) for your application. QtitanChart - Chart generation framework. Commercial. QtitanRibbon - For fans of the ribbons that Microsoft uses in their software. Commercial. qtnotify - Notification framework. QtTerminalWidget - Make your application capable of anything. QtVerbalExpressions - Create regular expressions using natural English expressions.

QtXlsx - Read and write spreadsheets in Microsoft Excel format. Qwt ðŸ“¦ - Qt widgets designed for scientific and technical applications. verdigris - Experimental library to write Qt applications without using the moc. Software Repositories If the Libraries section doesn't satisfy you, perhaps one of these will. #inqlude - The most well-known aggregation of Qt-centric libraries out there. A package manager is also available here. QtPods - Another Qt-centric package manager. If you want to see the offerings without using QtPods, the full list is available here, and can be added to by submitting a pull request.
