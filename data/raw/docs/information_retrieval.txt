Introduction Information Retrieval involves finding relevant information for user queries, ranging from simple domain of database search to complicated aspects of web search (Eg - Google, Bing, Yahoo). Currently, researchers are developing algorithms to address Information Need of user(s), by maximizing User and Topic Relevance of retrieved results, while minimizing Information Overload and retrieval time.

Datasets Standard IR Collections DBPedia - Linked data web. Cranfield Collections - This is one of the first collections in IR domain, however the dataset is too small for any statistical significance analysis, but is nevertheless suitable for pilot runs. TREC Collections - TREC is the benchmark dataset used by most IR and Web search algorithms. It has several tracks, each of which consists of dataset to test for a specific task. The tracks along with suggested use-case are: Blog - Explore information seeking behavior in the blogosphere. Chemical IR - Address challenges in building large chemical testbeds for chemical IR. Clinical Decision Support - Investigate techniques to link medical cases to information relevant for patient care. Confusion - Study Known Item Searching problem.

Crowdsourcing - Explore crowdsourcing methods for performing and evaluating search. Enterprise - Study search over the organization data. Entity - Perform entity-related search (find entities and their properties) on Web data. Filtering - Binarily decide retrieval of new incoming documents given a stable information need. Federated Web Search - Study merge performance for results from various search services. Genomics - Study retrieval efficiency of genomics data and corresponding documentation. HARD - Obtain High Accuracy Retrieval from Documents by leveraging searcher's context. Interactive Track - Study user interaction with text retrieval systems. Knowledge base acceleration - Study algorithms that improve efficiency of human Knowledge Base. Legal Track - Study retrieval systems that have high recall for legal documents use case. Medical Track - Explore unstructured search performance over patients record data. Microblog Track - Examine satisfaction of real-time information need for microblogging sites. Million Query Track - Explore ad-hoc retrieval over large set of queries. Novelty Track - Investigate systems' abilities to locate new (non-redundant) information. Question Answering Track - Test systems that scale beyond document retrieval, to retrieve answers to factoid, list and definition type questions.
