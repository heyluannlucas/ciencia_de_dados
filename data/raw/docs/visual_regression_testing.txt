Regression testing is a type of software testing which verifies that software which was previously developed and tested still performs the same way after it was changed or interfaced with other software. The purpose of regression testing is to ensure that changes to the software have not introduced new faults. Foreword This is intended to be an incomplete list of resources about visual regression testing. It is not tailored to a specific area or role (Developer/QA/UX-Designer). Note that this is for all areas of regression software testing after the code in question is written. For a awesome list on general software testing see e.g. awesome-testing. Finally, I'm sure everyone who reads this list has one thing they want to add. Please read the How to Contribute page and Feel free to add to the list!!.
