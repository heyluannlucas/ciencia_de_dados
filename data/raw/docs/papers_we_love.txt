This repository serves as a directory of some of the best papers the community can find, bringing together documents scattered across the web. You can also visit the Papers We Love site for more info. Due to licenses we cannot always host the papers themselves (when we do, you will see a ðŸ“œ emoji next to its title in the directory README) but we can provide links to their locations. If you enjoy the papers, perhaps stop by a local chapter meetup and join in on the vibrant discussions around them. You can also discuss PWL events, the content in this repository, and/or anything related to PWL on our Discord server. Chapters Let us know if you are interested in starting one in your city! All of our meetups follow our Code of Conduct. Past Presentations Check out our YouTube channel for videos and video playlists. Info We're looking for pull requests related to papers we should add, better organization of the papers we do have, and/or links to other paper-repos we should point to.
