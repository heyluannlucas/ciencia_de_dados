Validators Popular block explorers provide a list of active validators. The easiest entry point to view validator profiles is from a block explorer: List on Mintscan List on ATOMScan List on BigDipper List on Kujira POD DYOR when choosing a validator. Consider delegating your tokens to validators outside of the top 20 to increase the decentralization of the network. This is also a good practice to avoid 0% commission validators and exchange validators. Cosmos SDK Modules The best place to find an accurate list of the Cosmos SDK modules is the project repository: For a list of production-grade modules, see the List of Modules.
