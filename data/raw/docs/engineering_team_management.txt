How to Celebrate the Small Wins - My takeaway: ‚ÄúCelebrating Slow Progress; Hunt for Key Milestones‚Äù. Team Leader Venn Diagram - ‚ÄúA tool for gaining a shared understanding of responsibilities‚Äù. When your coworker does great work, tell their manager - Highlighting unseen work in public allows managers to recognize efforts their reports are doing. Still, there is some cases in which it might put your colleague in a tight spot. So always ask if it's ok first. Eye Candy QA - Retelling of author's job at Apple: ‚ÄúJohn Louch was my boss. (‚Ä¶) John always shared everything with us, even the don't share this with your team stuff. We were people he trusted, so it was as it should be. It made you feel like you were part of something greater.‚Äù Or why sharing some open secret promote strong trust in your entourage. The Apollo Syndrome - A phenomenon discovered by Dr Meredith Belbin, and exposed in his 1981 book on Management Teams, where teams of highly capable individuals can, collectively, perform badly. A conversation with Elon Musk about Starship - In a team with very talented contributors, everyone's is a chief engineer: you are expected to challenge the status-quo and questions other department's constraints. This allow smart engineers to avoid the trap of optimizing for something that should not exist in the first place. Might be a cure for the Apollo Syndrome. Symptoms of Groupthink - Overconfidence, tunnel vision and conformity pressure can led a group astray. It's Not Sabotage, They're Drowning - Some kind of push backs shouldn't be interpreted as intentional sabotage, but as drowning people sinking the lifeboat in an attempt to save themselves. ‚ÄúCommunity already exists, you just create a communication platform for it‚Äù (source) - Or why trying to create a community from the ground up might not be the right way of looking at things: a better and more subtle strategy would be to empowers the already existing channels and make them visible. OpenTeams - ‚ÄúTeams can visualize their network of interactions, and also, cross this data with information on a teams demographic, professional, and psychological characteristics.‚Äù As manager, make sure these metrics bring positive outcome to the team. It is easy to have them instrumentalized for political reasons. Engineering You're no longer an engineer. Still, your team is responsible for the systems, technology and all the processes surrounding them. You'd better know a bit about engineering tenets. The Technical Engineering Manager You shouldn't spend your time coding. Leave that to the engineers: your value lies elsewhere now. But does that means you must forget all things technical? The answer is an astounding NO. Here are some arguments: Do engineering managers need to be technical? - Yes. ‚ÄúLooking forward to the next 30 years of management trends, only a few things seem certain: Managers should be technical, and the definition of technical will continue to change.‚Äù If Your Boss Could Do Your Job, You're More Likely to Be Happy at Work - ‚ÄúAlthough we found that many factors can matter for happiness at work ‚Äì type of occupation, level of education, tenure, and industry are also significant, for instance ‚Äì they don't even come close to mattering as much as the boss' technical competence.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe best managers I met tended to be those that if the circumstance required it, could do the job of those two levels below.‚Äù (source) - Another way of putting it: managers needs domain knowledge and to know the work their reports do. ‚ÄúOver the years we have developed the policy that it is important for the supervisor to thoroughly know and understand the work of his group.‚Äù (source) - This quote is from David Packard (HP co-founder), decades before current management fad. Systems Complexity Whatever the technical stack, we are building systems first, and have to manage its complexity. Second-system effect - ‚ÄúTendency of small, elegant, and successful systems, to be succeeded by over-engineered, bloated systems‚Äù. Living with Complexity, by Donald A. Norman - In which we learn that, based on Tesler's law of the conservation of complexity, ‚Äúthe total complexity of a system is a constant: as you make the person's interaction simpler, the hidden complexity behind the scenes increases. Make one part of the system simpler, said Tesler, and the rest of the system gets more complex.‚Äù The Efficiency-Destroying Magic of Tidying Up - ‚ÄúEfficiency tends to look messy, and good looks tend to be inefficient.‚Äù A reminder that sometimes we should just accept the messiness of the world. I try to optimize my code around reducing state, coupling, complexity and code, in that order - An engineer's perspective on which priorities should be addressed first to increase robustness of systems. SpaceX's 5-Step design and manufacturing process - ‚Äú1. Make requirement less dumb; 2. Try to delete parts; 3. Simplify or optimize; 4. Accelerate cycle time; 5. Automate‚Äù. See full transcript. Technology Choose Boring Technology - ‚ÄúBoring, in the sense that it's well understood.‚Äù Choose Well-known Technology - A rephrasing of the above advice. ‚ÄúChoose the technology: 1. You know in and out, and are immediately productive with; 2. Which is sure to be around in 5-7 years, preferably 10-15; 3. For which you are comfortable hiring the next 15 engineers.‚Äù Industry Data Models - A huge list of database templates collected over 25 years by Barry Williams to represent any business process. I thought that using loops was cheating‚Ä¶ - How much is too much? Libraries, whether software or audio loops, are tools. A typical case of NIH syndrome transposed to music production. ‚ÄúLots of people make the mistake of thinking there's only two vectors you can go to improve performance, high or wide. High - throw hardware at the problem, on a single machine. Wide - add more machines. There's a third direction you can go, I call it going deep.‚Äù You need to be this tall to use (micro) services - Do not chase the hype. Yet. Micro-services only brings value past a certain infrastructure and organization size. This is a list of stuff you should focus on before bringing micro-services to the mix. LEGO blocks and organ transplants - ‚ÄúPeople have been comparing software components to LEGO blocks for a couple decades. (‚Ä¶) Integrating two software systems is usually more like performing a heart transplant than snapping together LEGO blocks.‚Äù ‚ÄúSoftware development is more akin to the product design and development phase of industrial production than to the manufacturing.‚Äù (source) - This quote is from a review of Superdistribution - Objects as Property on the Electronic Frontier, in which the creator of Objective-C was advocating in the 90's for a new economic framework that rewards creation of components in proportion to their use. But software production is not like manufacturing of widgets in a factory. A (software) object is not an (hardware) widget. Engineering Practices Software Engineering's Greatest Hits - When scientific method meet the practice of software development. My takeaways: the best metric is less lines of code, there is no 10x developers, too much unused configuration options, pair programing is for transfer of domain-specific knowledge and hackathon don't produce long term projects. Code reviews at Google - ‚ÄúWhy Should Code Reviews Be Fast? (‚Ä¶) To optimize for the speed at which a team of developers can produce a product together, as opposed to optimizing for the speed at which an individual developer can write code.‚Äù Google Engineering Practices - Explains how to perform code reviews and how to submit them. Embedded Rules of Thumb - Guidelines and heuristics to provide a reasonable approximation of the truth while developing embedded devices. Most also applies to software projects in general. How to Misuse Code Coverage - ‚ÄúIf a part of your test suite is weak in a way that coverage can detect, it's likely also weak in a way coverage can't detect.‚Äù I.e. the great benefit of a coverage report is that it tells you what you forgot to think about when you wrote the test suite itself (source). Technical Debt Tech Due Diligence Calculator - A list of questions by topic to help understand how you are building your tech and engineering team, trying to highlight red flags. Technical Debt Is Like Tetris - Another way to explain technical debt: ‚ÄúScenarios like these create technical debt within the product code. A buried gap in Tetris represents technical debt. (‚Ä¶) Paying down technical debt keeps you competitive. It keeps you in the game.‚Äù Technical debt as a lack of understanding - ‚ÄúThe problem lies in "never reorganizing [the code] to reflect your understanding." (‚Ä¶) Organizationally, you pay in velocity and turnover; talented people are going to leave after a few rounds of bullshit.‚Äù The Framing of the Developer - Default framing is around the backlog, which leads to an asymmetry in which failure is blamed on lacks of developer performance, and success is celebrated as the full realization of the PM's vision. But ‚Äútechnology is the bank that gave credit‚Äù, and technical debt should be called product debt ‚Äúbecause product took the credit to get a feature faster and must pay back by investing the time to clean up.‚Äù The alternative? ‚ÄúCompanies today need a frame of impact. In this world-view success is defined by impact.‚Äù Goodbye, Clean Code - ‚ÄúMy boss invited me for a one-on-one chat where they politely asked me to revert my change. I was aghast. The old code was a mess, and mine was clean! (‚Ä¶) I see now that my 'refactoring' was a disaster in two ways: I didn't talk to the person who wrote it; My code traded the ability to change requirements for reduced duplication‚Äù. Remote Work The Surprising Traits of Good Remote Leaders - ‚Äúthe confidence, intelligence and extroversion that have long propelled ambitious workers into the executive suite are not enough online because they simply don't translate into virtual leadership. (‚Ä¶) Instead, workers who are organized, dependable and productive take the reins of virtual teams.‚Äù As the source paper say it best: ‚Äúvirtually, the emphasis shifts from saying to doing.‚Äù Things to look for when hiring remote workers - ‚Äú1. You have to adhere to employment laws within the country you're hiring from; 2. To employ someone full time, many countries require you to have a legally entity within that country; 3. Prioritize countries where we have the most interest; 4. Keep a healthy timezone overlap in each of our teams.‚Äù Managing Remote Teams - A Crash Course - Compilation of easy rules and processes to bootstrap a remote team.

Awesome Remote Job - Resources on working remotely, including job boards, coworking spaces, and a list of companies embracing the culture. Meetings Two humans + a (virtual) room = a meeting. Dear Manager, You're Holding Too Many Meetings - ‚ÄúEmployee productivity was 71% higher when meetings were reduced by 40%. This is largely because employees felt more empowered and autonomous. Rather than a schedule being the boss, they owned their to-do lists and held themselves accountable.‚Äù How to have great meetings, according to 200 scientific studies - A roadmap for getting meetings right. Wadge's Law (of Meetings) - ‚ÄúBefore every formal meeting there's a smaller, more exclusive, less formal meeting where all the important decisions are made.‚Äù 1 on 1 The most important meetings you'll have are frequent 1:1s with your direct reports. ‚Äú1on1s are the managers Swiss army knife‚Äù (source) - Another advice from the source: make them walk'n'talks. Questions for our first 1:1 - A personal list of high-level questions from a manager. 1 on 1 Meeting Questions - A mega list in which most of them are great starters for conversation, some others are clearly bad ideas. A great source of inspiration nonetheless, but choose carefully. Standups A staple of agile decorum, too often misused. Your daily standups should be async. Here's why - ‚ÄúDaily, real-time meetings aren't practical for remote teams‚Äù might be the best practical reason. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly Standup - Author experienced 3 formats of stand-ups before ending with one working for his team, and concludes that ‚Äúthe details that make up a good meeting are subtle and the pursuit of an artificial standard of aesthetics will prevent you from doing the necessary experimentation to improve from an ugly equilibrium‚Äù. We Cancelled Standups and Let The Team Build. Here's What Happened‚Ä¶ - Team felt burned out by long, daily status update meetings masquerading as standups. Eliminating these faux standups got the team back on track. Facilities The environment we work in shapes us. Perks too. The impact of the 'open' workspace on human collaboration - Open-plan offices decrease face-to-face collaboration. Noise, Cognitive Function, and Worker Productivity - ‚ÄúAn increase of 10 dB reduces productivity by approximately 5%.‚Äù The Elves Leave Middle Earth ‚Äì Sodas Are No Longer Free - Company stopped providing free soda. The engineers were very upset, but it was just soda and they could afford it. But really it wasn't soda. Soda was the canary in the coal mine, triggering an exodus of its best engineers. Product Management The Product Manager is supposed to be the voice of the market.

I wasted $40k on a fantastic startup idea - A tale of building a product no user want to pay for. ‚ÄúYou can't just create value for the user: that's a charity. You also can't just create value for your company: that's a scam. Your goal is to set up some kind of positive-sum exchange, where everyone benefits, including you.

Project Management If product management is about what is to be developed of the product, then project management activities answers on how to deliver that development. It is all about the execution, with a particular attention to delivery critical path and planning. But don't worry too much, every company has its own definition of the two roles, and sometimes hybrid positions. Let's have no managers, instead of managers with no engineering experience - The title is misleading, article's argument is: we don't need project managers if we already have product managers and scrum masters. Best project management practices in 2018? - There is no silver bullet. Strategies for long Projects - Relentless, irrational optimism; Daily progress documentation; Compounding investments; Time budgeting. Developers can't fix bad management - ‚ÄúWhy do so many software projects fail? Software development is much closer to creating a new factory than running an existing factory. (‚Ä¶) Software development is made up of many unknown duration tasks, this fundamentally unpredictable nature makes traditional management's predictive planning techniques particularly unsuited for software projects.‚Äù Specifications ‚ÄúWalking on water and developing software from a specification are easy if both are frozen.‚Äù Edward V. Berard - Essays on object-oriented software engineering. The art of destroying software - Greg Young described a good way to deal with requirements volatility: optimize from the beginning to be able to delete your code, and structure your code so that any part of it is no bigger than 1 week's worth of coding. So that any part can be re-written in 1 week. Requirements volatility is the core problem of software engineering - ‚ÄúStart by accepting that change is inevitable. (‚Ä¶) As a consequence of this, software is never finished, only abandoned. (‚Ä¶) This means that no software product is ever exactly, perfectly satisfactory.‚Äù Estimations Time management and planning starts with estimates, but often degenerates into deadlines. Don't (guess)timate your projects, forecast with confidence - ‚ÄúThe problem with spending a lot of time on estimating is that it can feel useful, but often is so inaccurate that it hardly yields much value to the business.‚Äù The best we can do is measure and forecast. Dear Startup: You have no idea how much that costs - ‚ÄúWe are completely clueless about how long things should take.‚Äù Here is a trick to handle expectation of unreasonable estimates. Escalation of commitment - A.k.a. sunk-cost fallacy, or the rational explanation of why the hell do we still irrationally keep investing in a bad project. Who are you trying to impress with your deadlines? - ‚ÄúThere are companies where those deadlines are set in stone, and a missed deadline is next to fire. That's when the problem starts.‚Äù Apple Aperture: Senior QA - How not to manage projects approaching deadlines: ‚Äúcutting finished features, yelling at people, and working people to the point of nervous breakdowns. Then they came upon a brilliant idea: let's steal over a hundred engineers from other teams and then the project will magically get done on time.‚Äù Robert "Uncle Bob" Martin talk about professionalism in software development - The only honest estimate is "I don't know". But you can come up with some kind of propability assessment, that will inform about the shape of the risk. This is not unlike PERT, where an activity is bounded by optimistic, pessimistic and most-likely time. Now if managers don't take a range for an answer, don't fall in that trap. Tell them you're already trying as you possibly can. ‚ÄúAnd then the manager will have to do something very foreign: they'll have to manage. That's what management is: managing risk.‚Äù Why software projects take longer than you think: a statistical model - ‚ÄúConfirms the hunch that developers estimate the median well, but the mean ends up being much higher.‚Äù Developers spend most of their time figuring the system out - ‚ÄúA hand drawn picture about the current system is a belief. Decisions should never be based on beliefs. Not in engineering. (‚Ä¶) As software is highly contextual we cannot predict specific problems. We can only predict classes of problems.‚Äù And that's why it is hard to estimate software projects: because developer's main activity is a long process of deducting the assumptions a system is built on. Software effort estimation is mostly fake research - ‚ÄúThe NASA dataset contains 93 rows (that is not a typo, there is no power-of-ten missing), COCOMO 63 rows, Desharnais 81 rows, and (‚Ä¶) the China dataset contains 499 rows.‚Äù Tickets There Are No Bugs, Just TODOs - Issue trackers needs to materialize ownership, queue position, state, task breakdown and aggressive closing. Priority, ticket type, software version, severity and long-life tickets are anti-patterns. Delivery How I ship projects at big tech companies - ‚ÄúShipping is a social construct within a company. Concretely, that means that a project is shipped when the important people at your company believe it is shipped.‚Äù That is the dark side of delivery, in which you optimize for visibility by upper-management for the next performance evaluation cycle. Agile The SAFe Delusion - Curated review of facts, evidence, and opinions from relevant sources without vested interests, to help decision-makers make informed choices and get better results. How Big Tech Runs Tech Projects and the Curious Absence of Scrum - There's an interesting table in this article on the strereotypes of companies, their funding models, main engineering actors, and their central methodologies. Why do some developers at Google consider Agile development to be nonsense? - Because the short-term focused Scrum processes ‚Äúseem suited to particular types of development, most notably consulting or contract programming, where the customer is external to the organizations, runs the show because they are paying for development, and can change their mind at any time‚Äù. Still, google engineers already practice a culture close to what looks like the original 10-points Agile manifesto. But that's it. Story Points Revisited - The alleged inventor of story points says they are probably a mistake. Detecting Agile Bullshit - US Department of Defense guide to detect software projects that are really using agile development versus those that are simply waterfall or spiral development in agile clothing (‚Äúagile-scrum-fall‚Äù). ‚ÄúThe fundamental problem that drives most agile failures isn't in the team's execution, it's in the business' expectations. One side is signed up for incremental delivery, and one side is set up for a fixed scope and deadline and the result is misery.‚Äù (source) Failed #SquadGoals - Spotify doesn't use "the Spotify model" and neither should you - ‚ÄúWhy it didn't work? 1. Matrix management solved the wrong problem; 2. It fixated on team autonomy; 3. Collaboration was an assumed competency; 4. Mythology became difficult to change‚Äù. Recurring opinions or productive improvements ‚Äî what agile teams actually discuss in retrospectives - An 3-years analysis of a team's retrospectives, with dire conclusions: people keep forgetting what they already learned, keep discussing unsolveable problems out of their control, and keep debating opinions based on biased interpretations or incorrect understandings. Key Performance Indicator (KPI) KPIs are a set of quantitative measurements at the team or organizational level, to measure the success of the business. ‚ÄúNumerical goals set for other people, without a road map to reach the goal, have effects opposite to the effects sought.‚Äù - W. Edwards Deming SRE fundamentals: SLIs, SLAs and SLOs - If you are in the business of cloud services, these metrics are certainly great KPIs. The 4 Worst Software Metrics Agitating Developers in 2019 - The worst KPIs to track a software team output: Lines of Code, Commit Count, Issues Resolved (aka ‚ÄúShipping Velocity‚Äù) and Code Churn (aka "Efficiency"). Objectives and Key Results (OKR) OKRs are a framework. Extending KPIs, they applies individually to each members of an organization, down to the IC level. In theory, everyone is supposed to have its own set of OKRs. OKRs from a development team's perspective - On how OKRs articulates with a backlog. Team Objectives ‚Äì Overview - Why OKRs might not work at your company: 1. You're still using feature teams instead of product teams; 2. Mixed-up manager and individual objectives; 3. Leadership opting-out of active management. ‚ÄúOne way in which I've seen OKRs used effectively is as a defense against the type of middle or upper manager who is constantly coming up with new ideas or tasks.‚Äù (source) - Or how OKRs can be weaponized to prevent top managers to mess with the (already established) schedule. Why individual OKRs don't work for us - Spotify decision to stop using OKRs for individuals. Google's usage of OKRs - OKR grades are public, but not used for promotion. It was never taken very seriously there. Awesome OKR - There is no shortage of content on how to measure and communicate objectives. Training On mentoring, education and learning.

What Medieval People Got Right About Learning - ‚ÄúWhy apprenticeships beat classrooms‚Äù. Developer Roadmaps - Very high-level guides and paths to learn different practice and tools. Communication It is not only about reading, writing and talking. It encompass all the social practice and context sharing of the team's activities.

Knowledge On knowledge surrounding a team. What senior engineers do: fix knowledge holes - ‚ÄúThis is the textbook definition of a senior engineer. You see a problem, you solve it (thoroughly), you document it and you level up your team.‚Äù Chesterton's fence - ‚ÄúIf you're considering nominating something for deletion, or changing a policy, because it doesn't appear to have any use or purpose, research its history first.‚Äù It's not we'd like to play conservative here, but because we need to fix the knowledge hole as described above. You're Not Managing a Team of Software Engineers, You're Managing a Team of Writers - Because writing software is ‚Äúa creative process which is by its nature unpredictable and personal, in an environment which craves certainty, predictability and consistency.‚Äù Reading Before you know how to write, you need to know how to read.
