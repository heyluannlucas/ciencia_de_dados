GameMaker is a user-friendly, cross-platform game engine by YoYo Games that allows both beginner and advanced game developers to create 2D and 3D games for desktop, HTML5, and console platforms. What kind of games can you make in GameMaker? Check out this list. Contents Getting Started Utilities Debugging Input Handling User Interface Localization Physics Sprites Audio Levels Particles Lighting Shaders 3D Sprite Stacking Networking Integrations Camera Sequences State Machines Pathing Useful Extras Blogs YouTube Community Special Thanks Getting Started GameMaker Manual GameMaker Release Notes GameMaker Marketplace Beginner GameMaker Tutorials - Tutorials from Shaun Spalding. A comprehensive introduction to basic features of the IDE. Highly recommended to check out the full playlist if you're a complete beginner. Advanced GameMaker Tutorials - Tutorials from DragoniteSpam that dive into more advanced topics related to the GML language. They also have comprehensive 3D and shader introduction videos. Recommendations If you already have programming experience, learn the GameMaker Language (GML) instead of the Visual (Drag and Drop) feature. For pixel art, Aseprite is a popular alternative to the native sprite editor.  Aseprite's source code can be compiled for free. Don't be afraid to use other developer libraries. A lot of them are free for a reason. Just be mindful of the license. Updates to the IDE and runtime can break your game (like syntax changes to GML). If you are working in a group, make sure you are running on the same version of GMS and only update when given a fair warning. You can reinstall previous versions of your IDE at the GMS download page. Unless your game requires complex physics interactions, it's generally advised to avoid GameMaker's built-in physics system. Schedule routine backups for projects. If you are dealing with larger media files in your repo, try Git LFS.
