This research approach is often termed experimental, or empirical software engineering. Many of the data sets can also be useful in research using search-based software engineering methods. The repository is named after the Mining Software Repositories (MSR) conference series. For examples of such work see the MSR conference's Hall of Fame. This list requires your input for its continuous improvement. Read the contribution guide for instructions on how you can contribute. Alternatively, you can send me an email if you find the process too cumbersome or confusing. For more awesome lists, see awesome.
