Awesome Agi CocosciAbduction / Applications in AI Probabilistic Sufficient Explanations - IJCAI'21, 2021. [All Versions]. Understanding the behavior of learned classifiers is an important task, and various black-box explanations, logical reasoning approaches, and model-specific methods have been proposed. This paper introduces probabilistic sufficient explanations, which formulate explaining an instance of classification as choosing the "simplest" subset of features such that only observing those features is "sufficient" to explain the classification. That is, sufficient to give us strong probabilistic guarantees that the model will behave similarly when all features are observed under the data distribution. In addition, the authors leverage tractable probabilistic reasoning tools such as probabilistic circuits and expected predictions to design a scalable algorithm for finding the desired explanations while keeping the guarantees intact. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm in finding sufficient explanations, and showcase its advantages compared to Anchors and logical explanations.
