Regular expressions (regex or regexp) are a powerful and concise way to search, parse, and process text. They're built into many programming languages, text editors, IDEs, database engines, word processors, and other tools. Contributions are welcome. Add links through pull requests (guidelines).  Glossary A brief glossary of regular expression terms as used in this list. Regex engine: Software that interprets and executes regular expressions, either built into a programming language or as a standalone library. Regex flavor: A unique set of regex syntax and behavior. Basic syntax is typically shared across flavors, but more advanced features often vary, sometimes in subtle or incompatible ways. A flavor might be shared across multiple implementations or programming languages. Ex: The JavaScript flavor is defined by the ECMAScript spec; implemented by multiple engines (V8, etc.). Ex: The PCRE flavor is the PCRE2 library, used by numerous programming languages and tools. Ex: Ruby swapped its regex implementation twice from version 1.8  1.9  2.0, so each used a distinct flavor. The Ruby 2.0+ flavor is referred to here as either Ruby or Onigmo (the underlying regex library). Non-backtracking engine: A regex implementation that uses a non-backtracking algorithm and runs in linear time. This rules out worst case performance from superlinear backtracking, but it's slower with some patterns and precludes some useful features like backreferences. Featured resource Regex+ is a lightweight JavaScript library for more readable, high-performance, native JavaScript regexes with powerful features including free spacing, atomic groups, possessive quantifiers, subroutines, subroutine definition groups, and context-aware interpolation.

Starting with ES2018, includes links to the TC39 proposals where features were developed and discussed. ES3 (1999) introduced regular expressions. ES5 (2009) fixed unintuitive behavior by creating a new object every time regex literals are evaluated [explainer], and allowed regex literals to use unescaped forward slashes within character classes (/[/]/). ES6/ES2015 added: [explainer] Flag y (sticky), which anchors matches to lastIndex. Flag u (unicode) [explainer] [2016 spec fix], which adds Unicode code point escapes via \u{}, strict errors (for unreserved escapes, octal escapes, quantified lookahead, and unescaped special characters in some contexts), Unicode case-folding for flag i, and code point matching (with impact on quantifiers, character classes, ranges, and built-in sets). Getter RegExp.prototype.flags, the ability to copy a regex using RegExp (optionally with new flags), and support for subclassing RegExp (along with RegExp.prototype[Symbol.match/replace/search/split] and RegExp[Symbol.species]). ES2018 added flag s (dotAll), lookbehind, named capture, and Unicode properties (via \p{} and \P{} which require flag u; see list). ES2020 added string method matchAll (which returns an iterator), plus RegExp.prototype[Symbol.matchAll]. ES2022 added flag d (hasIndices), which provides start/end indices for matched substrings. ES2024 added flag v (unicodeSets) [explainer] as an upgrade to flag u, which adds a set of multicharacter "properties of strings" to \p{}, multicharacter elements within character classes via \p{} and \q{|}, nested character classes, set operators [--] and [&&], and different escaping rules within character classes. It also fixes case-insensitive matching for \p and \P within negated [^]. Each edition from ES2019 to ES2023 added additional Unicode properties that can be used via \p{} and \P{} (see lists). ES2021 added string method replaceAll, although, when given a regex, the only difference from ES3's replace is that it throws if not using flag g.

Chrome's l (linear) regex flag, behind a V8 flag [explainer] [how to run]. Can I use - Up-to-date browser support tables for individual features.  Future: Active proposals Duplicate named capturing groups (2022) - Ex: (?<a>)|(?<a>). Extended mode and comments (2021) - Flag x (extended) with insignificant whitespace and line comments (#), plus inline comments via (?#). Pattern modifiers (2021) - Ex: (?ims:), (?-ims:), (?i-ms:). Atomic operators (2021) - Atomic groups via (?>) and possessive quantifiers (ex: *+, ++). Buffer boundaries (2021) - Anchors \A and \z, not affected by flag m. \R escape (2021) - Outside character classes, \R matches any line terminator. Restrict subclassing support in built-ins (2020) - Scaled back RegExp subclassing. RegExp escaping (2015) - RegExp.escape. Legacy RegExp features (2015) - Standardization of legacy features.
