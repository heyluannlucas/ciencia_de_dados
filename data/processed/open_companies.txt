Table of contents What is an open company? Companies Resources Books Articles Videos Similar lists License What is an open company? An open company is defined, for the purposes of this list, as a for-profit organization whose core practices are guided by principles of openness, transparency and interoperability. This philosophy can be summarized by the maxim: Share as much as possible, charge as little as possible. derived from the original formulation by Gittip (now Gratipay). In practice, this often means: releasing its products as free and open source software, open content, or open source hardware using open standards and inter-operable formats developing its products openly, using public communication channels publishing as much financial and operational data as possible, without compromising customer privacy. etc. The following pages provide a more detailed overview of this concept: Open business: Wikipedia article Open business: from the P2P Foundation wiki Companies Company Openness Pledge Open Product Statement Open Finance Arduino LLC Arduino - Introduction Arduino Atlassian Company values  Atlassian N/A Axem DEM DEM Balsamiq Company  Balsamiq N/A Bevry Bevry DocPad Buffer Buffer's transparency dashboard: Public salaries, equity and more Misc Why we have a core value of transparency at our startup Revenue CodeCombat CodeCombat - Learn how to code by playing a game CodeCombat Why you should open-source your startup Couchbase Open Source Projects All Products Dangerous Prototypes About - DP Projects Daytona Open Source Daytona Documenso The Documenso Manifest Documenso Announcing Open Metrics Open Metrics Dreamwidth About Dreamwidth Studios Dreamwidth Elastic Openness, transparency, and collaboration are at the heart of all that we do.
