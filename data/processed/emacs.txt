Upgrading to the newest/current version of emacs (if emacs comes preinstalled on ones operating system) will give the best user experience, and it is advised to do so as soon as possible. Here are several resources to assist you as you start or continue your journey with emacs. Linux Use your favorite Linux package manager (e.g. apt, dnf, yum, pacman, etc) or build from source. Typically, either a relatively recent version of emacs or no instance of emacs will be on a default install of ones Linux distribution. macOS Use Homebrew or MacPorts to install emacs with a package manager. Also, consider Emacs for Mac OS X and the Homebrew Emacs Plus formula for installation candidates. The preinstalled version of emacs on a default macOS install is quite old. For an optimal emacs experience, upgrading to a newer version is highly recommended. Windows Emacs can be downloaded from the GNU FTP or a GNU mirror listed on the GNU Emacs Download & Installation page, and/or using the MSYS2 pacman manager. Another option is to install emacs via the Chocolatey or scoop Windows package managers. A default install of Windows does not contain emacs.

Please submit a pull request or create an issue to add a new package, library, or software to the list. Before contributing, please read this tiny guideline: The Order of Items Please dont rearrange the package ordering without any reason! The items should be sorted by its popularity ( roughly, because its impossible to have a precise standard. e.g. most people would use it; recommended for every newbie), instead of your personal preference. For example, Evil is obviously not a package that every Emacser needs. So please dont move it to the top of its category. In contrast, if you think a package is recommended for every Emacser (especially for a newbie), just place it at a higher place in the list. Emacs Built-In Packages If a package is available in the latest version of Emacs, please remember to add a [built-in] tag in the front of the description. Generate Table of Contents It is recommended to install toc-org which will update the Table Of Contents for you automatically on each save. It will also give you convenient navigation - if you press C-c C-o (org-open-at-point) when the point is on the entry in the Table Of Contents, you will jump to the respective section. If for some reason, you dont want to install it, you can download a single file toc-org.el manually, open it, and call M-x eval-buffer. Then change buffers to README.org. Subsequently, issue M-x toc-org-insert-toc within the README.org buffer. If a new category of packages has been added in your commit, the Table of Contents section will be revised and updated.
