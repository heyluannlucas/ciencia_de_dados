Background In 2010, Joshua Schachter, the founder of Delicious, posted the following on Hacker News: When I first started delicious, we had to host most of the services ourselves. CVS, mail, mailing lists, etc etc etc. These days, lots of that stuff is available as SaaS. What are the tools and services people use instead of hosting their own? (I'm not talking about actual production services like EC2 and Heroku and whatnot. We can go over this in another thread.) In 2013, Sharjeel Qureshi, posted the following: Few years ago, Joshua Schachter started this thread on HN for discussing hosted useful services: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1769910 The contribution in thread introduced many interesting SaaS services which can immensely help in deploying services as well as development. It's been three years since then. What do we have today? Many thanks to the big contributors to the previous threads, including garrettdimon, espeed, netshade, and cmadan, and many more that I haven't named. Now I've collected more data from Hacker News, AngelList and Quora, to make the 2015 and beyond version. This list also includes self-hosted as well as hosted services. It's on GitHub for a reason!
