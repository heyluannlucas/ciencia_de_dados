Contents About Official Resources Community Resources Tutorials Articles Demos Videos Tools Development Servers Plugins Watchers CSS Bundlers Transforms Node in the Browser Production Tools About Browserify lets you require('modules') in the browser by bundling up all of your dependencies. You can use a node-style require() to organize your browser code and load modules installed by npm.
