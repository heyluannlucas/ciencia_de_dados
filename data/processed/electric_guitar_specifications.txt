Important for good playability is balanced interaction of these components. Thicker neck often creates warmer tone. usacustomguitars.com/necks - many neck shape and thickness combinations musikraft.com - additional information for understanding of neck features.

Only careful measurement ensures that your parts will be compatible. Strat necks have a rounded base to their heel and Tele necks have a squared-off base to their heel, which makes it difficult to interchange the two types of necks across various bodies. Standard Fender heel mounting is done with 4-Bolt Holes - 1/8" (3mm) diameter (spread of 2" x 1-1/2"). Fretboard's Radius Smaller radius means a more rounded shape. 7-1/4" - "Vintage" Fender 9-1/2" - "Modern" Fender 10" - Gibson/PRS 12" - Ibanez 16" - Jackson compound (10" - 16") - Warmoth and others youtube.com - understring radius gauges - video demonstration of three different gauges used for guitar setup and fretwork: standard, notched and understring.

Big holes can be retrofited by adapter bushings. Guitar Bodies The sound of electric guitar depends mainly on the vibration behavior of the string itself and the reproduction characteristics of the pickup. The vibration behavior of the string depends (very little) on wood. The body itself is very thick compared to the neck, that is why the body wood type and form have very limited influence on the sound of electric guitar. music.stackexchange.com - how much does electric guitar's body physics affect the tone and playability. Body Shapes The shape of an electric guitar can historically be divided into the following categories: ST (Strat) T (Tele) Single Cut (LP) Double Cut (SG) Hollowbody Other Forms Bridge And Pickup Routing Overview Flat Mount Hardtail (Strat/Tele/Schaller) Tremolo (Strat) Tune-O-Matic (Gison) Other (Jazzmaster, Jaguar, Bigsby, Kahler, Line 6, etc) Picture left to right: American Standard Tremolo Routing and Single Coil Strat Pickup, Vintage Telcaster Routing and Single Coil Tele Pickup, Tune-O-Matic Style Routing and Habucker Pickup callahamguitar.com - technical specifications of some coustom parts.

Measure from the middle of the high string to the middle of the low string, directly over the pickup. If the distance is greater than two inches or 50mm, go for a Wide Humbucker. Exact specifications can be found on the manufacturer's website like: bareknucklepickups.co.uk - dimensions In addition to classic HH routing (2X hambuckers), there are the following variants: - SSS (Strat, Nashville Tele) HSS (Strat Humbucker im Steg, Modern Player Tele) HSH (Strat), HS (Strat, 72 Tele) SS (Tele), HP90 (Yamaha Pacifica), S (Tele Esquire), and some other exotic combinations Tuning Machines Tuning Machines Options: Configuration: 3L+3R (Gibson style), 6-in-Line (Fender style), 4L/2R (Musicman style) Diameters of bore holes for axis (see chapter Tuner Holes) Ratio - for 1x winding around the shaft head - 1x rotation necessary. Larger ratio (1:18 > 1:14) allows finer adjustments. Standard vs Locking - with locking tuners strings are inserted through the axle bore and fixed by a screw from the outside Bridges Guitar bridge has large influence on playability (mainly through string spacing). Wider string spacing is better for finger-picking style, narrow spacing gives easier control when playing leads with distorted tone. Bridge and Pickup Routing chapter above describes common bridge categories with string spacing specification. Bridge form and material have also some influence on sound. Good manufacturers provide detailed product information on their pages: ABM - Aluminium, Bell Brass and Steel comparison - indicates that Bell Brass and Steel shape the guitar sound with character, while Aluminum acts largely neutral in the transfer of tone. Hardware Parts Checklist The following list summarizes the accessories that are required to complete your own guitar building project Jacks & jackplates Neck plate (neck-to-body) Pickguard or pickup mounting rings Screws for all parts above Control plate (only for for standard tele) String ferrules (String-thru Top or Bottom - if you use "string through body" instead of bridge) String retainers. see premierguitar.com article about design and construction Strap holders For each screw, the hole must be pre-drilled to the core diameter (not outer diameter) Electronics Electronics exerts greatest influence on the overall sound of a solid-body electric guitar. buildyourguitar.com - The Secrets of Electric Guitar Pickups by Lemme - "If you know the resonant frequency and height of the resonant peak, you know about 90 percent of a pickup's transfer characteristics. Some other effects cannot be described using this model, but their influence is less important". Frequency response of a magnetic pickup may look like this Sound group Resonant frequency Resonant peak Example Pickup bright 3 - 6kHz high peak Fender single coils powerful 2 - 3kHz medium high peak Gibson PAF mellow 1.5 - 2kHz low peak Rolling back tone pot Following topics change resonant frequency and resonant peak: Pickup Properties - position and height of frequency peak vary from type to type. Sound Control With Switches - Hambucker coils are switched in series by default, switching them in parallel or using only one of the coils will increase resonant frequency and the sound will have more treble. Potentiometer and Capacitor Values changing provides also simple way to change resonant frequency and peak. Cable capacitance - longer cable will lead to lower resonant frequency. Amp input impedance Pickup Properties Dimension and product group - see chapter Puckup Routing Wiring: 1, 2, 3 or 4-Conductor (4-Conductor allowing most flexible wiring)* Position: Bridge, Neck, Middle Symmetrical vs asymmetrical connection type Output: low(vintage), medium, high (vintage used often for jazz and blues) Passive vs. Active (Active often used for distortion sound) D.C. Resistance: indication how much output a pickup will have E.Q. chat: A general idea as to the Bass, Mids and Treble. seymourduncan.com - pickup selector dimarzio.com - pickup picker Classic humbuckers are asymmetrical. They are internally wired in series (i.e. serial - brings more power) in opposite phase (less noise). The current multi-Conductor PUs offer the option of switching the coils differently using push / pull pots, mini switches, toggles, mega switches and rotary switches, and allow broad control over the sound directly on the guitar.

However, that needs power to operate, and that's its biggest drawback. Custom Buffers (german) - used to decouple the guitar electronics from the sound influencing effects on the shielded cable. Strings Depending on following options your sound will be more bright or more mellow: Construction (Flat Wound/Round Wound) Material (Steel/Nickel) and Tension Most manufacturers use following naming convention to describe tension of string set: Name 'e' site approx.

Scale has a relatively low impact on sound and playability of the guitar. (Compared with other parameters such as strings or pickups). Longer scale length sound and playability characteristics: quick response, crisp attack transparent sound with well-defined basses and heights larger finger spread higher string tension at constant gauge Shorter scale length sound characteristics: warmer more sustain and longer decay Common Scale Length: 572 mm (22.5") or shorter - 3/4 & some travel guitars 596,9 mm (23.50") - Fender Jazzmaster/Jaguar guitars 629 mm (24.75") - many Gibson guitars 635 mm (25") - many PRS guitars 648 mm (25.5") - many Fender guitars 650 mm (25.5) - typical classical guitars 686 mm (27") or longer - Baritone guitars Woods Woods Sound Weight Used for Looks Alder bright medium T/B bright, simple Ash bright medium T/B bright, simple Basswood neutral light B bright, simple Bubinga bright medium T/B/N/F red, often grained Ebony bright heavy N/F dark Maple very bright heavy T/B/N/F bright, often grained Koa warm medium T/B/N dark, grained, attractive Korina warm medium T/B/N grained, attractive Mahogany warm medium T/B/N red Poplar neutral medium B bright, simple Rosewood warm medium T/B/N/F dark Sitka Spruce neutral light T/B bright, simple Swamp-Ash neutral light T/B bright, attractive Walnut bright medium T/B/N gray, attractive Wenge bright heavy T/B/N/F dark  Sound: the diagram for effects on tone stands mainly for acoustic instruments and NOT for solid body guitars, where other components have much larger impact on sound.
