PostCSS simply provides a css parser and a framework for creating plugins that can analyse, lint, handle assets, optimise, create fallbacks, and otherwise transform parsed css. PostCSS parses css into an abstract syntax tree AST, passes it through a series of plugins, and then concatenates back into a string.
