It is not tailored to a specific area (Usability/Performance) or role (Automation/Management). The idea is that you could hand this list to a CS graduate and it would greatly improve their testing skills, efficiency and overall breadth of knowledge. Note that this is for all areas of software testing after the code in question is written (no unit tests/static analysis!). Finally, I'm sure everyone who reads this list has one thing they want to add. Please read the How to Contribute page and add to the list. :) Contents Software Books Training Blogs Newsletters Suggested Awesome Lists QA & Testing Road Map Others Contributing Code of Conduct License Software API Testing CORS Tester - A tool for developers and API testers to check if an API is CORS-enabled for a given domain and identify gaps.
