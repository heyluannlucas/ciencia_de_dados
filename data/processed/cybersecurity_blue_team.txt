Cybersecurity blue teams are groups of individuals who identify security flaws in information technology systems, verify the effectiveness of security measures, and monitor the systems to ensure that implemented defensive measures remain effective in the future. While not exclusive, this list is heavily biased towards Free Software projects and against proprietary products or corporate services. For offensive TTPs, please see awesome-pentest. Your contributions and suggestions are heartily  welcome. (). Please check the Contributing Guidelines for more details.

Many cybersecurity professionals enable racist state violence, wittingly or unwittingly, by providing services to local, state, and federal policing agencies or otherwise cooperating with similar institutions who do so. This evil most often happens through the coercive mechanism of employment under threat of lack of access to food, shelter, or healthcare. Despite this list's public availability, it is the maintainer's intention and hope that this list supports the people and organizations who work to counter such massive albeit banal evil.
