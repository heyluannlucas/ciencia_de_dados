What is MongoDB?MongoDB is a document database designed for ease of application development and scaling.You can run MongoDB in the following environments:MongoDB Atlas : The fully managed service for MongoDB deployments in the cloudMongoDB Enterprise : The subscription-based, self-managed version of MongoDBMongoDB Community : The source-available, free-to-use, and self-managed version of MongoDBGet started with MongoDB AtlasWhat You Can DoWork with your data in MongoDBStore and query your dataTransform data with AggregationsSecure access to your dataDeploy and scale your database1Deploy MongoDBCreate a cluster in the MongoDB Atlas UI or the Atlas CLI quickly and easily. To learn more, see Create a Cluster in the MongoDB Atlas documentation and Get Started with Atlas in the Atlas CLI documentation.For self-hosted deployments, see Replication in the MongoDB manual to create a replica set.2Connect to your deploymentAccess deployments in the MongoDB Atlas UI or connect with drivers or the MongoDB Shell (mongosh) in the MongoDB manual.To learn more, see Find Your Connection String in the MongoDB manual.3Insert, query, update, or delete documentsPerform CRUD operations in the MongoDB Atlas UI or by using the MongoDB Query API - with or without transactions.To learn more, see Create, View, Update, and Delete Documents in the MongoDB Atlas documentation and MongoDB CRUD Operations in the MongoDB manual.4Model your dataDesign your data schema to support frequent access patterns. You can update or enforce your schema at any point.To learn more, see Data Modeling Introduction in the MongoDB manual.â atlas setup? Do you want to setup your Atlas database with default settings?

You can preview the results at each pipeline stage when you run aggregation pipelines in MongoDB Atlas.To learn more, see Run Aggregation Pipelines in the MongoDB Atlas documentation and Aggregation Operations in the MongoDB manual.test> db.orders.insertMany([ { "item" : "almonds", "price" : 12, "quantity" : 2 }, { "item" : "pecans", "price" : 20, "quantity" : 1 },])test> db.inventory.insertMany([ { "sku" : "almonds", "description": "product 1", "instock" : 120 }, { "sku" : "cashews", "description": "product 3", "instock" : 60 }, { "sku" : "pecans", "description": "product 4", "instock" : 70 }])test> db.orders.aggregate([ { $match: { price: { $lt: 15 } } }, { $lookup: { from: "inventory", localField: "item", foreignField: "sku", as: "inventory_docs" } }, { $sort: { price: 1 } },])1Authenticate a clientVerify the identity of a user, replica set member, or sharded cluster member with authentication.To learn more, see Atlas UI Authenication in the MongoDB Atlas documentation and Authentication in the MongoDB manual.2Control access to your databaseEnable Role-Based Access Controls to manage user privileges on your entire database cluster or individual collections.To learn more, see Atlas UI Authorization in the MongoDB Atlas documentation and Role-Based Access Controls in the MongoDB manual.3Encrypt your most sensitive dataClient-Side Field Level Encryption protects data while it is in-use by the database. Fields are encrypted before they leave your application, protecting them over the network, in memory and at rest.To learn more, see Client-Side Field Level Encryption in the MongoDB manual.1Create a clusterCreate a free cluster, an auto-scaling cluster, or a serverless instance in the MongoDB Atlas UI. To learn more, see Choose a Cluster Type in the MongoDB Atlas documentation.For self-hosted deployments, provide redundancy and resilience for your database by deploying a replica set. To learn more, see Replication in the MongoDB manual.2Scale out your databaseUse sharding to horizontally scale your database or to ensure location-based separation of data.To learn more, see Shard a Collection in the MongoDB Atlas documentation and Sharding in the MongoDB manual.Related Products & ResourcesGo Further with MongoDBExplore libraries and tools for MongoDB.Use MongoDB in your application's languageLearn about DriversVisually explore your data with MongoDB CompassView Compass DocsManage and monitor your deploymentsView Ops Manager
